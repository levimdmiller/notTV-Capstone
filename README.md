Capstone Software Engineering Project at UBC Okanagan, 2017/18.
A torrent based video sharing service backend and web application front end for use with Raspberry Pi's.
A spring backend supports a ReactJs front end to deleiver a de-centralized video viewing and sharing experience.

The aim of this project is to create a prototype for a peer-to-peer video sharing service to satisfy notTV’s vision. Users of the notTV service require a Raspberry Pi computer which acts as a media box, allowing them to upload their own media as well as have access to other media on the network in an efficient and streamlined process. Each Raspberry Pi is intended to store some of the network’s media and be used to distribute media to other boxes. The software has three main components which work together to offer the experience that notTV is looking for: a peer-to-peer upload/download system,  a central server, and a web-based GUI.

The peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing system uses the BitTorrent protocol for sharing files between devices. The system manages file upload and download, and local storage of files.
